# Educational Keylogger - For Cybersecurity Awareness

This project is a simple keylogger developed for **educational purposes** and **cybersecurity awareness**.  
It demonstrates how keyloggers work and teaches users how to defend against them.

 üîç How It Works
- The script listens to **keyboard input** and logs keystrokes into `log.txt`.
- It **filters special keys** like `Shift`, `Ctrl`, and `Alt`.
- Logs are **stored locally**, and the script does **not** send data anywhere.

 How to Protect Yourself
1. Use a reputable antivirus** to detect unauthorized keyloggers.
2. Check background processes** for suspicious applications.
3. Enable on-screen keyboards** when entering sensitive data.
4. Use endpoint protection solutions** that prevent keylogging attempts.
