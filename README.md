# Educational Keylogger - For Cybersecurity Awareness

This project is a **simple keylogger** created for **educational purposes** to demonstrate how keyloggers work and how to defend against them in the realm of **cybersecurity**.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The script listens for **keyboard input** and logs the keystrokes into a local file called `log.txt`.
- It filters out **special keys** such as `Shift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, and `Enter` to keep the log clean.
- The keystrokes are **stored locally** in a text file and **not sent to any external servers**.

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Disclaimer
- This project is intended **for educational purposes** only and should not be used for any malicious activities.
- **Do not use this keylogger on any system without explicit permission.** Unauthorized use may violate privacy laws and ethical guidelines.
- The author **does not take responsibility for any misuse** of this code.

## 🛡️ How to Protect Yourself
While keyloggers like this are a security concern, you can take measures to protect yourself:
1. **Use reputable antivirus and endpoint protection software** to detect and block keyloggers.
2. **Be cautious with downloading and running unknown scripts** or software from untrusted sources.
3. **Monitor running processes** and check for unusual background activity on your system.
4. **Use on-screen keyboards** for sensitive data entry (e.g., passwords) to avoid hardware keyloggers.
5. **Keep your operating system and security tools up to date** to ensure protection against new threats.

## 🚨 Warning
This code is for **ethical hacking** training and **cybersecurity awareness**. Always respect privacy laws and ethical standards. Only use this code in **controlled environments** where you have explicit permission (e.g., penetration testing labs, educational environments).
